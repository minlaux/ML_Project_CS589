\section*{Introduction}
This report provides an analysis of the application of various machine learning projects on several datasets.
The goal is to identify the best-use scenarios of model variants given the nature of input data.
In this report, the authors analyze the
\begin{itemize}
    \item Decision Tree, \textit{provided by Polina Petrova}
    \item k Nearest Neighbors, \textit{provided by Polina Petrova}
    \item Neural Network, \textit{provided by Yan Mazheika}
    \item Random Forrest, \textit{provided by Yan Mazheika}
\end{itemize}
against the handwritten digits, titanic survival, loan eligibility, and Parkinson's classification datasets.
\\

It is our aim to explain the nature of the data, our models, and the performance of these classifiers. Throughout our report,
we justify our algorithm choice for the given dataset and our choice of hyper-parameters for the tuning of the algorithm. These insights
are for the reader's benefit; we also aim to provide insight into how to solve novel machine problems, which algorithms may work best, and how
to adjust their hyper-parameters for optimal performance.
